# Dice-Game
Lets roll the dice...

The result of my first taste of DOM manipulation. Using simple JS functions and basic DOM manipulation, this is a two player dice game that I spent time tweaking the rules and fine tuning my CSS positioning of the page elements to my liking. 


There is a seperate JS file that contained challenges from the course instructor Jonas Schmedtmann to tweak certain aspects, which was my first true time wrestling with a project without assistance.
