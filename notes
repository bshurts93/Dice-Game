DOM: Document Object Model
    - A structured representation of an HTML document
    - The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JS
    - For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with
    
**JAVASCRIPT and DOM are two different things!**

    - HTML content is stored in the DOM
    - In JS, the object that gives us access to the DOM is "document"
    - document.querySelector('#some-id') selects the element
    - document.querySelector('#some-id').textContent = "something"  to change text in the HTML doc
    - document.querySelector('#some-id').innerHTML = "something"  to add HTML content
    - document.querySelector('.some-class').style.display = 'none'   to change display
    
    
EVENTS: notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.
    - Clicking buttons, resizing window, scrolling down or pressing a key

EVENT LISTENER: Function performing an action based on a certain event, waits for specfic events to happen.
    - Follows execution stack (returns executions in order)
    - Message queue contains events in the browser, goes once execution stack is empty
    - Event listeners get their own execution stack
    - document.querySelector('.some-class').addEventListener('eventType', 'someFunction')

CALLBACK FUNCTION: a function that is called by another function. 
    - Callback functions are passed into other functions as arguments.
    
ANONYMOUS FUNCTION: a function that does not have a name, so it cannot be reused.
    - function() {
    //do something here
    };
    
    
TYPE COERSION:
    - Undefined, 0, null or " " are COERCED to false
